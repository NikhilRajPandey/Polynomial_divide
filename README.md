# Polynomial_divide
# About This
This is a program to calculate divison for two polynomials in C++ that we have read in class(IX/X)
Like If this is divisor "-x^2+x-1" and this is dividend then "-x^3+3x^2-3x+5"
Then it will return Quoitent +1x-2 and Reminder +3.
For More Information how to use the class then go into main function where i have created some examples. I <br> will create its cli version soon.

# Special Note
***I have written so bad english in the program,readme.md then if you don't understand any segment of the code <br>then create issue for it.***
